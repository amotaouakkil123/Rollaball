Hi!

You've stumbled on my attempt at Rollaball using the Unity Engine. This was the project that
introduced me to a lot of the topics I am studying in computer graphics now and other game engine
practices that I am still finding use in my robotics work.
I am including a small video where I am demonstrating my ball jumping, going through a rotating platform and collecting cubes with an updating counter.
This was an interesting introduction to the Unity Engine and I hope to be working with it a lot more
in conjunction with other engines out there.
The source code for the project is uploaded to this repository alongside incomplete parts.

Here is the link to the video of the test Rollaball: https://youtu.be/Hmcih_Rqbhg
